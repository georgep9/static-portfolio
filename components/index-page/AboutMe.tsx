        <p>
          My passion and interest for technology, and how we use it to create solutions on top of existing accomplishments, continues to motivate me as a software engineer. Developing technology to improve the productivity and quality of everyday life.

        <p>
          University knowledge and industry experiences in embedded systems, computer science, web development, and server-less computing has bootstrapped my early career with strong foundational skills. I now specialise in full-stack development and cloud.
