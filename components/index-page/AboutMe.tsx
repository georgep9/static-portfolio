        George Patterson - <small className="text-primary">Graduate Engineer</small>
      </h3>
      <p>
        My passion and interest for technology, and how we use it to create solutions on top of existing accomplishments, continues to motivate me as a software engineer. Developing code to improve the productivity and quality of everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
        University knowledge and industry experiences in embedded systems, computer science, web development, and distributed-decentralised systems has bootstrapped my early career with strong foundational skills. I now specialise in full-stack development and cloud as a graduate engineer.
